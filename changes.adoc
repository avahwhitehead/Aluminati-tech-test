|Change |Reason

|Removed HelloWorld.vue
|This component is not used and is unrelated to the application.

|Added type definition to `numbers` array
|Unnecessary typing errors can mask genuine issues later on.

|Made curly braces consistent between methods and loops
.3+|Consistent style makes code easier to read.

|Ensured all lines end with a semicolon

|Converted spacing to tabs

|Changed a `var` declaration to `let`
|The loop variable does not need to be declared as global scoped

|Changed the `numbers` array definition
|The previous way was creating 100 arrays in the process with a spread operator, which is an unnecessarily complex and resource intensive process.

|Extracted `numbers` array creation out of a method
|This produces cleaner, more readable, code and reduces the likelihood of future modifications triggering unexpected reordering.

|Removed unnecessary logging statement
|The statement was unnecessary to the code execution and was just contributing to code clutter.

|Changed to using `ref` and `watch` for rendering the numbers list
|Using an explicit `watch` definition to trigger an update on the list makes the code clearer and easier to understand.

|Removed `document.querySelectorAll` calls
|Using Vue's built-in reactive state management makes the code easier to read and more performant.
Additionally, the way these calls were written was causing many unnecessary operations to be performed.

|Renamed methods to be more descriptive
|Descriptive methods allow for more easily understandable code

|Commented code and added jsdoc definitions to methods
|Well commented code is more readable and easy to understand

|Scoped `style` tag
|Styles should be limited to the defining component to reduce the possibility of conflicting with other stylings.

|Made page title relevant to the page
|This makes the page more user friendly as they can see what the page is while they are in another tab.
