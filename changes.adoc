|Change |Reason

|Removed HelloWorld.vue
|This component is not used and is unrelated to the application.

|Added type definition to `numbers` array
|Unnecessary typing errors can mask genuine issues later on.

|Made curly braces consistent between methods and loops
|Consistent style makes code easier to read.

|Changed a `var` declaration to `let`
|The loop variable does not need to be declared as global scoped

|Changed the `numbers` array definition
|The previous way was creating 100 arrays in the process with a spread operator, which is an unnecessarily complex and resource intensive process.
